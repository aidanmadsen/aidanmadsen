# Hello!!
My name is Aidan (he/him) and I am currently a first-year student studying information technology at Vancouver Island University.

## Current Projects
### Home File Server
I am currently working on a home file server that supports multiple user accounts, and outside access using a VPN.

*Hopefully more coming soon...*

## Looking forward to learning...
Looking forward to learning stuff about networking and server administration! Would love to collab on any sys-admin-related projects!
